# HospitAI
The Final Project of Data Science & AI Bootcamp by Saudi Digital Academy and Le Wagon.

## overview :
Our project aims to create a model that predicts the Stay Duration of patients in the hospital, helping decision makers to effectively allocate and manage resources.

### Problem :
lack of Critical Resource like rooms, beds, medication, and other supplies needed for patient care.

### Solution :
Hospital Stay Duration Prediction Model

## Dataset :
[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsahani/hospital-admissions-data) you can see our dataset that which we used it in our project.

## Methodology :
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Train/Val/Test Method
5. Model Selection
6. Model Trainig
7. Model Evaluation
8. Model Deployment
9. Create a Project Package
10. Create a Streamlit Page

## Our Model and results :
We are using the KNeighborsRegressor from scikit-learn, that predicts the Stay Duration for patients.

The model produced an MAE of 2.48, meaning the average error between the predicted and actual Duration of Stay is around 2 days.
